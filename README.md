Haar-Fused Adaptive Feature Pyramid Network for Deficiencies Segmentation in Culverts and Sewer Pipes
Haar-Fused Adaptive Feature Pyramid Network (HFFPN), a novel architecture designed for the semantic segmentation of deficiencies in culverts and sewer pipes. HFFPN integrates a bottom-up pathway that incorporates Inception-like blocks with varying filter sizes (3x3 and 5x5), parallel max-pooling, and additional spatial detection layers. This design enables the network to capture multi-scale features and fine structural details. Throughout the network, depth-wise separable convolutions are employed to reduce complexity. The top-down pathway of HFFPN focuses on generating high-resolution features through upsampling and information fusion using 1x1 and 3x3 depth-wise separable convolutions. HFFPN achieves state-of-the-art results with an Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 77.18%, surpassing prior methods by 8.9%. With the incorporation of Haar-like features, it achieves an impressive IoU of 94.75%, outperforming existing approaches by 29.9%, all while utilizing significantly fewer parameters. HFFPN thus provides a powerful and efficient solution for accurate semantic segmentation in challenging real-world scenarios.
